# 🏦 ATM OTP & Face Recognition System  

A **secure ATM simulation system** built with **Django**, integrating **OTP verification** and **face recognition** using **DeepFace** and **OpenCV**.  
This project demonstrates how AI-powered biometric authentication can be combined with traditional OTP-based security for financial systems.
